#User Feedback from lab

* Give descriptions for components and skills when you hover over them so the user knows what to expect

* There are 2 refresh buttons when creating a sprite, so get rid of the old one and only put the new one.

* Don't force the user to type in a string when choosing an image for the sprite. Either a file chooser or a dropdown box

* If file chooser is closed, then a stacktrace is printed

* Visual recognition of which tab you're currently on

* General data sends to all different screen creation classes

* Add attribute doesn't automatically close the pop up windown it is in

* Weird refresh button in the add attribute window. Don't need

* Nested panes in the sprite editor which is bad looking. Don't want this in final version

* Cannot re-open the general data tab. No button for this

* Implementation in all the attributes; no one knows what this is
